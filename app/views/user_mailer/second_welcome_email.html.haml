      Dabble Me helps you remember what's happened in your life - now that you've written your first entry, you're well on your way. That's something to feel good about! If you have any questions you can send an email to
      =mail_to("hello@#{ENV['MAIN_DOMAIN']}", "hello@#{ENV['MAIN_DOMAIN']}")+"."
    %p
      %b Here's what you wrote...
    %p
      = format_body(@first_entry.formatted_body)
    - if @first_entry_image_url.present?
      %p
        =link_to image_tag(@first_entry_image_url, style: 'max-width: 100%; border-radius: 4px;'), @first_entry_image_url
    %p
      You can check out your entry here:
      =link_to "https://#{ENV['MAIN_DOMAIN']}/entries", "https://#{ENV['MAIN_DOMAIN']}/entries"
    %p
      %strong Don't see your last entry here?
      You may have a formatting issue. Make sure your email reply is above the Dabble Me content.
